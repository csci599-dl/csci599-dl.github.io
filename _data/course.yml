name:   'Deep Learning and Its Application'
description: 'Recently, many AI-related problems have seen great improvements â€“ for example, from image search, to machine translations, to self-driving, and to medical applications. Our goal is to guide students to get familiar with these recent cutting-edge deep learning (DL) advances in computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics. Through this course, students will gain the basic understanding of DL algorithms, and acquire practical experience in applying DL techniques to a variety of problems how to setup and solve problems involving deep learning techniques. The course will include a couple of practical assignments and a final course project. For the final course project, students will be encouraged to pick their own topics, but can also select from a  provided list of projects.'
