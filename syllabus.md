## Course Description
---
Recently, many AI-related problems have seen great improvements – for example, from image search, to machine translations, to self-driving, and to medical applications. Our goal is to guide students to get familiar with these recent cutting-edge deep learning (DL) advances in computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics. Through this course, students will gain the basic understanding of DL algorithms, and acquire practical experience in applying DL techniques to a variety of problems how to setup and solve problems involving deep learning techniques. The course will include a couple of practical assignments and a final course project. For the final course project, students will be encouraged to pick their own topics, but can also select from a  provided list of projects.

#### Prerequeiste(s):
1. Proficiency in Python
2. College Calculus, Linear Algebra
3. Probability and Statistics
4. Equivalent knowledge of CSCI 567 (Machine Learning)

#### Required Readings and Supplementary Materials:
Deep Learning (MIT Press) by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville. Free online version is available at [Here](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/)

#### Description and Assessment of Assignments
2 Assignments, 1 Midterm, and 1 Course project

#### Grading Breakdown

| Entry             | % of grade      | 
|:-----------------:|:---------------:|
| Participation     | 5               |
| Assignment #1     | 15              | 
| Assignment #2     | 15              | 
| Midterm           | 25              |
| Course project    | 40              |  
| TOTAL             | 100             |

***Extra credit***: each assignment (up to 1 point), midterm (up to 2 points), and course project (up to 3 points).

#### Assignment Submission Policy
All assignments need to be submitted in a paper form by 5pm of the due date.

#### Additional Policies
There will be **a total of 5 late days** for the entire semester, to be used in integer amounts and distributed as the student sees fit. Any exception needs to be discussed within the first 2 weeks of the semester (no exception otherwise). Note that there is **no late day for the final course project presentation**.
